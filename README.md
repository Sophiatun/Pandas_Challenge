**Background**

This project aims to provide valuable insights to assist the school board and the mayor in making informed strategic decisions related to forthcoming school budgets and educational priorities.

**Analysis**

Based on the overall analysis, there are some significant trends in the City School data related to school spending, school size, and school type

Scores by School Spending:
Schools that spend less per student (<$585) tend to have better academic performance. This suggests that more spending doesn't necessarily translate to better academic outcomes. Schools with tighter budgets may be using their resources more efficiently or have other factors contributing to their success.
Scores by School Size:
There is a notable difference in academic performance based on school size. Small and medium schools with fewer than 1,000 students tend to outperform larger schools. The larger schools may face challenges related to managing a higher number of students, while smaller schools can provide more personalized attention to their students.
Scores by School Type:
Charter schools consistently outperform district schools across various academic metrics. This could be due to differences in governance, teaching approaches, or other factors that make charter schools more effective in delivering quality education.
